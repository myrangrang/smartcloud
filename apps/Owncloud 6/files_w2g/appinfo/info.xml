	<description>Pseudo multiaccess-management feature for Owncloud. You can lock files and disable the fileactions, leaving only the fileaction of unlocking a file.
	For example, you are trying to edit a calculation table. You can download the file, lock it and start editing the file on your computer. Every person, you have shared the file with,
	will see that this file is currently locked, so others will leave the file alone. 
	This feature is webinterface only.</description>
